# question2:

# -----------

# According to the question, you need to change either the discount factor or  

# the noise. Complete 1. and 2. by deleting one of the options inside the 

# bracket, and give brief explanation to 3.

# 1.  I modified the noise parameter.

# 2.  I decreased the default value.

# 3.  Why does the change work?

#     Answer: Ideally the agent would also go straight toward the goal state (with 100 utility), 
however due to noise, there is a chance that even if the agent tries to head straight for the goal, 
it will fall off the bridge. Therefore, if you change the noise to 0, there is no chance of falling 
off the bridge, so the agent will happily cross over to the finish and collect the 100 utility reward.

# question3:

# -----------

# In this layout, you are asked to provide parameters that causes the agent to 

# have distinct optimal policy types, as described in subproblems a.~e.

# Based on your choice of parameters, answer the following:

# 1.  In the layout, the close exit (+1) has smaller reward than the distant 

#     exit (+10). Intuitively, optimal agents seek actions with high utility,

#     so what did you do to make agents in a. and b. to favor the close exit

#     (+1) instead of the distant exit (+10)?

#     Answer: Decreasing the discount (making in closer to 0), will make the distant goal less attractive 
because it is farther away, and a small discount factor will decrease the utility of going farther.

#     

#     

#     

# 2.  In both a. and c., the agent risks the cliff in order to get to the goal,

#     yet in b. and d. the agent acts more conservatively by taking the longer 

#     route. What is the key parameter(s) for such difference?

#     Delete the ones in the bracket that you think is irrelevent.

#     The parameter {discount factor/noise/living reward} decide(s) the level of 

#     conservatism of an agent.

#     

# 3.  For your answer in 2., why do you think so?

#     Answer: The noise is the key parameter, because although the agent will never
 purposefully jump down the cliff, if the noise is non zero, then there is still a
  chance it will fall down when walking along the cliff. So decreasing the noise makes the cliff safer.

#     

#     

#

   

# question6:

# -----------

# After finishing this question, explain what the importance of noise is?

# Answer: Noise makes it more difficult for the agent to get across the bridge to the high utility state, 
because when it's exploring further down the bridge, even if it knows not to jump off the bridge, it may 
still fall off due to noise, however that would still decrease the expected utility of further crossing 
the bridge, making it increasingly difficult to ever explore further. Therefore, noise will change the 
expected utility of states.
